# Gender Attitudes and Psychological Effects in Clinical Psychology
This study aims to examine the impact of gendered attitudes on individuals' psychological states in clinical psychology. It will explore how gender perceptions and conformity to societal norms affect psychological health, offering insights for therapeutic interventions.

# 1. General Comment on the Code:

The code aims to process, analyze, and interpret data from clinical psychology variables, primarily focusing on various subscale scores and their analysis through normality tests and t-tests, based on gender. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

## 2. Inverse Scoring for Dimensions:
The code starts by reversing certain variables (e.g., BF1, BF2) to align them with the desired scale for consistency in analysis. This is a common approach when using Likert-type scales where higher values are desirable, and reverse-scoring is necessary for certain negatively-worded questions.

## 3. Subscale Score Calculation:
It computes subscale scores for multiple dimensions by taking the average of related variables (e.g., CR_Protective_Sexism, CR_Heterosexual_Closeness). This is done for both the "Protective Sexism" and "BF" dimensions, which involve complex clinical psychology constructs related to gender roles, emotional detachment, and dependency. The use of rowMeans helps in synthesizing the relevant items for each subscale.

## 4. Normality Tests:
The normality of each subscale score is tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test (shapiro.test). The results indicate that none of the subscale scores follow a normal distribution, with p-values well below 0.05. This finding is essential for deciding whether parametric or non-parametric tests should be used in subsequent analyses.

## 5. Gender Comparisons:
Gender differences are analyzed using t-tests, comparing subscale scores across male and female participants. For each subscale (e.g., Heterosexual Closeness, Protective Patriarchy, Intergender Complementary Differentiation, and The "Self" Position), the code generates t-tests to examine if there are significant differences between the gender groups. The t-tests show that there are no significant differences in scores across gender groups for most subscales, with the effect sizes being small or moderate. This suggests that the gender differences are not practically significant, aligning with the hypothesis that these clinical dimensions may not vary much by gender.

## 6. Table Outputs:
The code uses the apaTables package to create formatted tables for the results of t-tests, which are saved as Word documents. This approach is useful for generating well-organized and professional tables for inclusion in academic reports or publications.

## 7. File Saving:
The results of the statistical tests, along with tables summarizing the t-test outputs, are saved as Word documents for easy documentation and presentation.
